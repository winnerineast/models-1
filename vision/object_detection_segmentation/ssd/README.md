## Inference

### Input to model
Image shape `(1x3x1200x1200)`

### Preprocessing steps
The images have to be loaded in to a range of [0, 1], resized to (1200, 1200) with bilinear interpolation and then normalized using mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. The transformation should preferrably happen at preprocessing.

The following code shows how to preprocess a NCHW tensor:

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

def preprocess(img_path):
    input_shape = (1, 3, 1200, 1200)
    img = Image.open(img_path)
    img = img.resize((1200, 1200), Image.BILINEAR)
    img_data = np.array(img)
    img_data = np.transpose(img_data, [2, 0, 1])
    img_data = np.expand_dims(img_data, 0)
    mean_vec = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
    stddev_vec = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    norm_img_data = np.zeros(img_data.shape).astype('float32')
    for i in range(img_data.shape[1]):
        norm_img_data[:,i,:,:] = (img_data[:,i,:,:]/255 - mean_vec[i]) / stddev_vec[i]
    return norm_img_data
```

### Output of model
The model has 3 outputs.
boxes: `(1x'nbox'x4)`
labels: `(1x'nbox')`
scores: `(1x'nbox')`

## Validation accuracy
Metric is COCO box mAP (averaged over IoU of 0.5:0.95), computed over 2017 COCO val data.
mAP of 0.195

Backbone is ResNet34 pretrained on ILSVRC 2012 (from torchvision). Modifications to the backbone networks: remove conv_5x residual blocks, change the first 3x3 convolution of the conv_4x block from stride 2 to stride1 (this increases the resolution of the feature map to which detector heads are attached), attach all 6 detector heads to the output of the last conv_4x residual block. Thus detections are attached to 38x38, 19x19, 10x10, 5x5, 3x3, and 1x1 feature maps. Convolutions in the detector layers are followed by batch normalization layers.

## Description
AlexNet is the name of a convolutional neural network for classification,
which competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2012.

Differences:
- not training with the relighting data-augmentation;
- initializing non-zero biases to 0.1 instead of 1 (found necessary for training, as initialization to 1 gave flat loss).

## Model input and output
### Input
```
data_0: float[1, 3, 224, 224]
```
### Output
```
softmaxout_1: float[1, 1000]
```
### Pre-processing steps
### Post-processing steps
### Sample test data
random generated sampe test data:
- test_data_0.npz
- test_data_1.npz
- test_data_2.npz
- test_data_set_0
- test_data_set_1
- test_data_set_2

## Results/accuracy on test set
The bundled model is the iteration 360,000 snapshot.
The best validation performance during training was iteration
358,000 with validation accuracy 57.258% and loss 1.83948.
This model obtains a top-1 accuracy 57.1% and a top-5 accuracy
80.2% on the validation set, using just the center crop.
(Using the average of 10 crops, (4 + 1 center) * 2 mirror,
should obtain a bit higher accuracy.)
